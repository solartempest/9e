## Flashing

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    qmk compile -kb solartempest/9e -km via

-   Please note that QMK toolbox and configurator cannot be used to flash this board.
-   You will need to use an ISP Programmer to directly flash the 9e. No board reset is required, as you will flash the MCU directly.
-   I used Prog ISP V2.0 but other AVR programmers will also work.
-   Use a 12P AWM 20624 ribbon cable with FCP-12P-1.0mm breakout board. Only 10 pins are used.

## Using with VIA

-   After flashing, in VIA make sure to Import Keymap, which is "9e VIA keymap.json". This will alow VIA to recognize the updated layout and custom functions. VIA will not auto-recognize the keyboard with this firmware because of the necessary customization.
-   Go to Save+Load to Load Saved Layout. You can import my own layout "9e VIA layout.json" or just use the Keymap tab to assign your own keys. Having another keyboard connected can be handy for doing this step.
-   It is a good idea to Save Current Layout after you decide on your mapping.
